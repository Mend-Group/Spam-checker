Certainly! Below is a simple example of an HTML form that you can use as a spam checker. This form includes a basic input field for the user to enter a message and a submit button. You can integrate server-side code (such as PHP) to perform spam checking based on your specific requirements.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Spam Checker</title>
</head>
<body>

<form action="/check_spam.php" method="post">
    <label for="message">Enter your message:</label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" cols="50" required></textarea><br>

    <!-- Add any additional input fields or spam prevention techniques here -->

    <input type="submit" value="Check for Spam">
</form>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the form's `action` attribute is set to "/check_spam.php," indicating that the form data will be sent to a server-side script (in this case, a hypothetical PHP script named "check_spam.php"). You should replace this with the actual path to your server-side script.

On the server side, you can implement spam-checking logic based on your requirements. This may include analyzing the content of the submitted message, checking for common spam patterns, or using third-party services for spam detection.

Keep in mind that effective spam checking often requires a combination of client-side and server-side techniques. Additionally, this example provides a starting point, and you may need to customize it based on your specific needs and the programming language you are using on the server side.
